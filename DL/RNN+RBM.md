#Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application to Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription


###Keywords  
recurrent neural network - incorporates an internal memory that can summarizes the entire sequence history
Restricted Boltzmann Machine - notes appear together in correlated patterns or simultaneities. 

###Restricted Boltzmann machines 
There is an energy function defined for the system. The system tries to lower the energy function. 
Boltzmann Machine - have links between neurons in the same level
Given a desired distribution, how to sample it with RBM.

###Recurrent neural network
Each layer of RNN seems like a nerual network. When the system goes to the next layer, the previous layer's information will be carried to the next layer.
