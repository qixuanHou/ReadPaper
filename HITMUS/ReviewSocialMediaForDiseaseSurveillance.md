#Using Social Media for Actionable Disease Surveillance and Outbreak Management: A Systematic Literature Review.

##Summary

Social media may be valuable tools in the disease surveillance toolkit used for improving public health professionalsâ€™ ability to detect disease outbreaks and enhance outbreak responses. The review answers the following two questions:
Can social media be integrated into disease surveillance practice and outbreak management to support and improve public health?

Can social media be used to effectively target populations, specifically vulnerable populations, to test an intervention and interact with a community to improve health outcomes? 
The paper concludes that even though there are plentiful papers demonstrates the effectiveness of social media in supporting and improving public health and in identifying target populations for intervention, there are limited use of social media in practice in this area.

*Q 1* - Intervention into surveillance practice and outbreak management. The studies mainly focused data collected based on keyword search from social media, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The works were classified into Influenza-like Illeness, Infectious Diseases, Non-infectious Diseases, Medication and Vaccines, and Other. All studies showed early reports than standard surveillance. It is a new idea to me that social media discussions can be used to determine attitudes, misinformation, and adverse events related to medications, vaccines, and other drug uses.

*Q 2* - targeted vulnerable population. These studies focused on certain group of users. It is a limited data set. Social media can serve as a platform for the officials to spread useful knowledge about how to prevent certain diseases among targeted users. 

The review paper gives me a basic knowledge about recent studies of using social media in healthcare and helps me identify the problem involved in the process which is how to make social media actually used in practice.
