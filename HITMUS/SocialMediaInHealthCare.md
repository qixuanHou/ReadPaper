#Social Media: A Review and Tutorial of Applications in Medicine and Health Care

##Summary

The paper provides me better understanding of how social media are being used in health care. As mentioned in the paper, social media are dynamic and interactive from population with diverse backgrounds. Because of that, several concerns were proposed about using social media in healthcare, such as no guidelines, ethnic issues, privacy, and professionals. The paper is organized by types of social media, including blogs, microblogs, online group, wikis, mashups, collaborative filtering, media sharing sites, multi-user virtual environments and other social media. 

The part which attracts my attention is the dynamic and concise characteristics of microblogs, such as Twitter. People tends to like posting an idea on Twitter with several sentences and form groups with others sharing the same interests, backgrounds and activities. The group propagates new ideas in the certain area, such as medical conditions and some of the groups may be professional involved discussion in depth. 

Wikis as mentioned in the paper are easy-to-publish websites that can be quickly and easily edited by different users. It is widely used in medical world but researchers found that the accuracy of currency of the documents in wikis are not really good. How to enhance and monitor the correctness of documents in wikis about medication is a challenge right now. 

I am currently working closed with Twitter because of its huge amount of data. However, I never thinks about groups in social media before. The paper inspires me to dig into the hidden groups on Twitter, such as retweeting and sharing same hashtags. The relationship between users in Twitter may enhance the accuracy of my work and also may help me identify potential improvement of the entire system.
