#Can Twitter predict disease outbreaks? 

##Summary

The paper identified three successful usages of social media to help healthcare, quicker detections, disaster response, and official sues. The paper started with a successful story about using Twitter to inform chronically ill patients where they could obtain essential medicines while the entire infrastructure was destroyed by the earthquake in Japan.

The traditional methods of surveillance to monitor outbreaks of disease is by collecting diagnostic information from doctors and laboratory reporting of test results. Digital surveillance platforms, such as HealthMap (www. healthmap.org) and BioCaster (http://born.nii.ac.jp), are developed as digital surveillance platforms to support healthcare surveillance. However, the information extracted are not reliable and verified. In my opinion, there is always tradeoff involved when we need to balance accuracy and speed. A critical point will be found by both Computer Scientists and disease experts to achieve great speed with tolerant accuracy. 
 
The paper concludes integration social media to existing disease surveillance system is not mature. More works are needed to ensure the security of personal information on social media and to figure out the ways to do the integrations.

The paper inspired me to integrate disaster response and official uses to the system. However, geotagging is a  problem for disaster response with social media. Even though most social media platforms, such as Twitter, and Facebook, have the build-in geotagging for users for posts, only 0.77% users actually use geotagging. Therefore, using social media raises the geotagging and the filtering problems.
