#Multi-hazard Detection by Integrating Social Media and Physical Sensors

##Summary

The paper proposed a new landslide detection service, LITMUS, which composes information from a variety of sensor networks including both physical sensors (e.g. seismometers for earthquakes and weather satellites for rainfalls) and social sensors (e.g. Twitter and YouTube), applies multiple strategies to filter noises and geo-tag entries from social sensors, provides a generic approach to the composition of multiple heterogeneous information services. 

LITMUS utilizes not only physical sensor data but also data from social media. The strategy is perfect for multi-cause disasters, such as landslides, which can be caused by heavy rainfall or earthquakes. With only physical sensors such as seismometers for earthquakes and weather satellites for rainfalls, we can only conclude there are high chances that certain locations may have landslides but we cannfot actually detect the exact location of landslides. Therefore, social media becomes important in the system.

LIMUS provides me a great starting point. However, LITMUS can only be built for  a specific event, such as landslides as demonstrated in the paper. I am thinking about a generic system for detecting all types disasters to support fast and efficient healthcare. LITMUS provides concrete steps to build a multi-sources system, from collecting data, classifying data, to integrating components. I only need to modify severals steps to generalize the system for all types of disasters.
