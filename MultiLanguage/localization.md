###Internationalization 
Internationalization (sometimes shortened to "I18N , meaning "I - eighteen letters -N") is the process of planning and implementing products and services so that they can easily be adapted to specific local languages and cultures, a process called localization . The internationalization process is sometimes called translation or localization enablement . Enablement can include:
- Allowing space in user interfaces (for example, hardware labels, help pages, and online menus) for translation into languages that require more characters
- Developing with products (such as Web editors or authoring tools) that can support international character sets ( Unicode )
- Creating print or Web site graphic images so that their text labels can be translated inexpensively
- Using written examples that have global meaning
- For software, ensuring data space so that messages can be translated from languages with single-byte character codes (such as English) into languages requiring multiple-byte character codes (such as Japanese Kanji)

###Difference Localization Vs. Translation
Localization - appeal to the customerâ€™s cultural preferences in their own target language.
