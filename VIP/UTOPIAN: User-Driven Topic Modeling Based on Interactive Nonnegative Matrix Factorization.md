##UTOPIAN: User-Driven Topic Modeling Based on Interactive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization

####Summary of the work...

**UTOPIAN provides various interaction capabilities: **

-  topic merging

-  document-induced topic creation

-  topic splitting

-  keyword-induced topic creation


**topic modeling outputs**


- a representation of each topic in terms of a weighted combination of keywords

- a representation of each document in terms of a weighted combination of topics


**Keywords**
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)



####Can be used for...
We have the same goal which is "discovering topics in document collections and providing the user with a summary of a document corpus in terms of, for example, keyword summaries of computed topics and a group of documents closely related to each topic".
